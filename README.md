  - This is the setup and routing for the backend of a make believe e-commerce business

  ## Credits

  - EDx Bootcamp through the University of Denver provided the starter code, guidance materials and tutoring for me to complete this project.
  
  - Additionall I recieved help from T.A's in the classroom, my instructor and StackOverflow. I also utilized code checking tools such as ChatGPT and Bard to help me ensure my code was formatted properly, used proper syntax, and was properly structured after writing it.
